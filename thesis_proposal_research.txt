Free-Energy Landscape of Proteinâˆ’Ligand Interactions Coupled with
Protein Structural Changes
The Journal of Physical Chemistry B Kidera et al. 2017 doi:10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b11696
- all-atom explicit solvent calculations that utilized multi-scale enhanced
  sampling (MSES)
- they were able to create a free energy surface of the _coupling_ using the
  structural ensemble from the MSES, though they say the surface is in terms of
  both the protein and ligand degrees of freedom
- they state that they are interesting in exploring how coupling between the
  degrees of freedom of the protein and ligand affects the distribution of
  conformers each explores
- a challenge in determining this is the separation of timescales for ligand
  diffusion, ligand-protein interaction, and protein structural change
- they developed MSES to be able to overcome the timescale separation problem;
  they want to look at the process starting from the encounter complex and
  ending with the native bound state
- it couples all-atom MD with accelerated dynamics based on coarse-graining the
  degrees of freedom and Hamiltonian replica exchange that eliminates bias by
  coupling to the CG model
- scaling enhanced sampling to a whole protein is challenging; they limit
  conformational sampling of MM to an "essential subspace" defined with small
  dimensions from the CG model
- their "multiscale" potential includes terms for the MM and CG systems, plus a
  harmonic coupling term that accelerates the MM system based on movement in
  the CG system
- however, they want a free energy surface based on the MM, without bias
  attributable to the CG system, so they calculate the joint distribution of
  r_MM and r_MMCG via Gibbs sampling and extrapolate it to k_MMCG=0 (k is the 
  coupling constant)
- they also introduced an adiabatic separation between the MM and CG
  simulations for efficient sampling
- this adiabatic separation ensures that the CG system is not influenced by 
  the MM system, and then in the detailed balance condition they can use the
  same CG system for many replicates of the MM system, which results in useful
  cancellation of a hard-to-calculate term
- overall, they iteratively run MD simulations for r_MM and r_CG, followed by
  MCMC sampling of k_MMCG
- \mu^2 lib was used for multicopy and multiscale MD
- 

Binding Kinetics in Drug Discovery
Molecular Informatics de Fabritiis et al. 2016 doi:10.1002/m inf.201501018
- they note that in the past affinity was used as a proxy measure of drug
  efficacy, but now dissociation rate is also considered to be important
- kinetics are governed by the energy of the transition state
- K_D might be a poor descriptor of \emph{in vivo} efficacy because other
  interactions violate the equilibrium condition assumed in the \emph{in vitro} tests
- residence time can provide a better measure of \emph{in vivo} selectivity and
  a higher residence time can mean greater efficacy even if the drug has higher
  affinity for other proteins (e.g. muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity)
- k_on is affected by dose and limited by diffusion limit, absorption,
  distribution
- k_off is affected only by target-drug interactions, so it is more directly
  affected by tuning and amenable to iterative optimization
- like many areas in contemporary biology, increased computational focus has 
  been made possible by improved experimental techniques that yield more, 
  better data faster and more easily:
    - radioligand binding, TR-FRET, fluorescence anisotropy, intrinsic
      fluorescence: suitable for membrane systems, direct determination of
      k_off and k_on, low-throughput and labor intensive, the first one generates
      radioactive waste, requires high-affinity ligands, requires recombinant
      receptors in animal tissues
    - Label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR): no label required, low
      material consumption, medium throughput, usualy only for soluble
      proteins, immobilization of receptor required
    - enzymatic assays: no label required, short development time, knowledge of
      mechanism required
- affinities can be estimated with one or a few reaction endpoints, but
  kinetics require complete reconstruction of binding pathways
- there are two main techniques to reconstruct the system's motion at
  biologically relevant timescales:
    - Brownian dynamics: macromolecules follow Brownian motion; solvent moves
      faster so it's coarse-grained - replaced by stochastic force. this
      reduction in computational complexity permits exploration of motion on
      timescales much longer than those probed by MD. it has been used to look
      at protein-protein association kinetics including barnase-barstar
    - BD has more recently been used to provide kinetic quantitative estimates
      e.g. for HSP90 and MDM2 inhibitor residence times
    - inaccuracies are definitely a problem; to recover experimental values
      model corrections must be applied in general. need to account for things
      like desolvation shells, polarization, and entropic effects
    - alternatively you can use MD enhanced sampling methods e.g.
      conformational flooding, adaptive force bias, local elevation,
      metadynamics, or umbrella sampling with WHAM
    - these are used to obtain a PMF usually, but can be combined with other
      methods to reconstruct binding kinetics
    - e.g. bias-exchange metadynamics, though BEMD by itself can't provide
      absolute estimates of kinetic parameters - it's used to compare
      congeneric molecules or provide meta-stable states to be used in kinetic Monte
      Carlo simulations
    - random acceleration MD (RAMD) identifies unbinding pathways by applying a
      force vector with a random direction to a bound ligand; it can provide
      relative kinetic estimates, or predict an unbinding pathway to be used in
      umbrella sampling or steered MD (SMD)
    - then umbrella sampling or SMD can be used to construct a PMF or to
      compute absolute k_on and k_off values using transition state theory
    - see e.g. method used for ligand unbinding from cytochrome P450cam or
      carazolol from \Beta_2 AR
    - a major limitation of many methods is that reaction coordinates are
      generally hand selected, and you need these to construct a PMF, so if
      that is part of the process, there's a major risk of missing something in the
      landscape
    - tuning pulling forces is also a risky process, since you need to ensure
      unbinding with minimal effects on the energy landscape
- improved computing resources have recently made unbiased brute force calculations 
  for some systems feasible (yeah!)
- obligatory discussion of ANTON and resulting publications; in particular,
  replicate studies performed with high concentration of ligands per box in
  each simulation; include distance-dependent repulsive force to prevent compound
  aggregation
- k_on was determined for such studies by calculating the frequency of binding
  events and then accounting for the concentration
- GPUGRID.net uses BOINC to distribute computing resources for MD simulations 
- it was used to study benzamidine binding to trypsin protease at 5 mM
  concentration (a fast fragment-binding event); 495 simulations of 100 ns each
  were performed leading to 197 binding events within 2A RMSD of the crystal
  structure
- these results were used to create a Markov State Model that was then used to
  reconstruct binding intermediates, transition rates, and affinities,
  apparently with good accuracy (but ok, results were known, N=1, etc.)
- another study, this one of AmpC B-lactamase, was able to recapitulate and
  characterize the role of a loop in close proximity to the binding site
- one more: 42 fragments were simulated with factor Xa, a serine protease that
  has two known druggable pockets. With more than 2ms of simulation time they
  could obtain thermodynamic, pose, and kinetic estimates in "good agreement" 
  with experimental results
- sometimes simulations were respawned from interesting states manually
  selected by a human in order to enhance sampling without biasing it (does
  this really not bias anything? they say that you effectively discretize the
  activation energy into "epochs")
- adaptive sampling uses a Markov state model to respawn from interesting
  states automatically
- these reduce the simulation time that would be required if you were
  brute-forcing the calculations, but how accurate are they really? need to
  follow up. for the Pande paper referenced, they just state that the kinetic
  parameters they computed were of the right order of magnitude
- they note that MD has provided some theoretical insight into binding
  behavior in general, for example suggesting that slow kinetics may result
  when "water-shielded hydrogen bonds" prevent water molecules from stabilizing
  the transition state

Energy Landscape Topography Reveals the Underlying Link Between Binding Specificity and Activity of Enzymes
Nature Scientific Reports Wang et al. 2016 doi:10.1038/srep27808

- this quote: "PPE requires several essential residues for catalysis, but PHBH
  accomplishes the catalytic reaction through only a co-factor. The substrate 
  of PPE is a large long-chain molecule, whereas the substrate of PHBH is a 
  small aromatic molecule. Both the binding and catalyzing processes of PPE and 
  PHBH are different. Therefore, the study of the activity of these two systems 
  is comprehensive and representative." LOL
- goal is to explore energy landscape of enzyme-substrate interactions and
  demonstrate correlation between specificy and activity, then find enzyme
  activity hotspots in the energy landscape to design e.g. more active enzymes
- introduce "intrinsic specificity ratio" to represent landscape topography
- k_cat/K_m is the enzyme activity or "specificity constant"
- k_cat is related to the catalytic reaction barrier, while K_m is related to
  binding free energy
- they define ISR as \delta E / \Delta E \sqrt{2s}, where \delta E is the energy
  gap/slope between the native state and the average energy i.e. \delta E := |E_n - \bar{E}|, 
  \Delta E is the roughness of the distribution of binding energies, and s 
  is the entropy / N
- they state that "exploring ligand interactions with the receptors through
  the sequences (different receptors) and exploring the ligand interactions with 
  a receptor through conformations (different binding modes) are equivalent
  for large receptors." what do they mean? I think they are referring
  only to the case of measuring specificy, since they make the general statement
  above to justify their claim that comparing specificity of ligand across
  different receptors is equivalent to comparing ligand specificity to different
  conformations of the binding site
- in the supplement they state the \delta{E} is the "slope" of the landscape and
  \Delta{E} is the energy fluctuation or width of the energy distribution of 
  the decoys, and reflects the roughness of the landscape
- then they can actually quantify the energy gap per contact interaction,
  \delta{E}/N, and \Delta{epsilon}^2 := \Delta{E}^2/N, the effective width of
  the energy distribution per contact interaction
- ISR can be used to show the changes in energy landscape topography for a
  mutagenic series of enzyme-substrate complexes, and that should correlate  
  with changes in k_cat/K_m
- additionally, if you fix either conventional specificy (binding affinity
  difference) or kinetic specificity (catalytic rate), the change in enzyme
  activity should be consistent with a change to the other characteristic
- "conventional specificity" here is the difference in affinity between the
  true binding pair in its true pose and the alternatives, e.g. the difference
  in affinity between the wild-type and mutant forms of the enzyme, or
  generally the same ligand binding to different receptors
- the reaction barrier of the catalytic reaction is used as the kinetic
  specificity
- mutant enzyme systems have a less funneled energy landscape than the wild
  type
- as far as the energy landscape goes, they just create two dimensional figures
  of the PMF for selected important reaction coordinates 
- ISR correlation with activity is lower than activity correlation with
  conventional or kinetic specificity, which seems bad given that I thought the
  point of ISR was to improve prediction of activity
- also the activity they use appears to be calculated from simulation data,
  _not_ experimental?

The Free Energy Landscape of Small Molecule Unbinding
PLoS Comp Bio Caflisch et al. 2011 doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002002

- weaker affinity ligands have b/u transition states that are closer to the
  bound state (manifestation of Hammond behavior)
- construct landscape via complex network analysis and the minimum cut-based
  free energy profile method
- for each ligand and temperature value (310 or 350 K), 50 independent MDs of
  no greater than 20ns were performed
- snapshots clustered by DRMS of pairwise intermolecular distances using the leader algorithm
- unbinding times were extracted directly from the trajectories
- network was generated with spring-embedder algorithm, nodes are clusters of
  snapshots from the MDs
- cut-based FEP is a projection of the free energy surface that preserves
  barriers and can be used to extract folding pathways and mechanisms from simulations
- compute partition function from number of direct transitions observed between
  nodes along the time series
- network edges with minimum flow are transition edges
- the unbinding TSE/Hammond behavior is maybe worth remembering/looking into
- they note that it might be interesting to analyze the free energy landscape
  of binding for small molecules with very similar chemical structure but very
  different affinity for a protein, e.g. a series of protein kinase inhibitors
  that differ by only one or two heavy atoms but have an affinity range that
  spans micromolar to nanomolar affinity

Imaging G proteinâ€“coupled receptors while quantifying their ligand-binding free-energy landscape
Nature Methods Muller et al. 2015 doi:10.1038/nmeth.3479

- appears to be an _experimental_ method for reconstructing the free energy
  landscape
- the key experimental technique is force-distance curve-based atomic force
  microscopy
- also of interest is that PAR1 (a GPCR) has an N-terminal domain that, after
  undergoing cleavage, serves as a "tethered ligand"
- AFM tip is derivatized with variants of this domain as well as other
  hexapeptides, and then it undergoes a sinusoidal movement to ensure
  intermittent contact of the AFM tip with the sample
- the AFM approach works by varying the effective concentration of the ligand
  near the receptor; this is realistic for the tethered ligand case, but could
  in theory enable even low affinity ligands to bind a receptor in the general
  case
- landscape projection is on force and loading rate axes

Protein Folding, Binding and Energy Landscape: A Synthesis 
"Protein Engineering" Chapter 10, Fu et al. 2012 doi:10.5772/30440

- they note that protein folding and binding are similar processes and the only
  real difference between them is the presence or absence of chain connectivity
- conformational selection is primarily an entropic process, plays a role in
  the first contact between a protein and ligand, and determines binding specificity
- induced fit is primarily an enthalpic process, based on bond formation,
  determines binding affinity
- time/pathways are kinetic properties, where kinetics defines the energy
  barriers between different system states
- relative probabilities/populations/lifetimes of conformational substates are
  thermodynamic properties that correspond to free energy
- this article is kind of trashy in that it occasionally refers to
  nonscientific things, but maybe it's useful for finding relevant references
- protein dynamics have kinetic (timescale of fluctuations) and structural
  (amplitude of fluctuations) components

Free energy landscape for the binding process of Huperzine A to acetylcholinesterase
PNAS Jiang et al. 2013 doi:10.1073/pnas.1301814110

- they use existing energy landscape theory developed in the context of protein
  folding to protein-ligand binding
- they claim that their method allows both binding free energy and binding
  kinetics to be estimated accurately
- they actually predict activation free energies of association and
  dissociation, but the quantity we probably actually care about for drug
  discovery is drug target residence time (1/k_off)
- drug efficacy does not always linearly correlate with binding affinity -
  binding kinetics also matters
- if you have a binding free energy landscape, you can get k_on and k_off via
  the Eyring equation if you know the transmission factors
    - if you don't know the transmission factors, just getting the activation
      free energy of dissociation is probably sufficiently informative for drug
      discovery
- they claim that previous methods that could provide kinetic parameters were
  inaccurate and required large-scale molecular simulations (and theirs won't)
- workflow:
    - identify possible binding pockets/gorges for ligand entering/leaving the
      active site (via MOLE)
    - create lattice model of protein by constructing a large box around it and
      then subdividing it into a bunch of smaller boxes (lattices)
    - reconstruct the binding configuration space by docking the ligand into
      the lattices that cover the possible binding pockets and their
      entering/leaving paths
    - calculate the binding free energy for each binding configuration
    - construct BFEL surface and use it to compute thermodynamic/kinetic
      quantities of interest from the binding/unbinding pathways
- they claim novelty from improving the MM-GBSA method and from a new algorithm
  for binding configuration sampling that is a multiobjective flexible-docking
  method
- their MM-GBSA improvement appears to be in part a mixed-resolution
  approach where full pairwise interactions are considered in the binding site
  but the rest of the receptor is treated with a grid-based approach
- the other thing they do is reweight the energy terms; not sure how this is
  theoretically justified
- they used the standard GBSA equation for the binding free energy as their
  scoring function and objective function for docking
- nonsorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) was used to optimize poses for
  docking
- in the BFEL: x axis is minimized RMSD between instantaneous conformation of
  HupA and that at the active site of TcAChE; y axis is the distance between
  mass centers of HupA at an instantaneous configuration and that of HupA at the
  active site; z axis is calculated binding free energy
- xy plane divided into 500x500 mesh grids, scatter data of binding free
  energies were fitted to the grids using Gridfit, and nearest neighbor algo
  was used to interpolate data points, and the result was smoothed
- generate binding pathway using coarse grained grid, with movement along grid
  points determined by energy at those points and no back moves permitted
- goal is to identify lowest-energy pathway from gobal minimum (active site) to
  bulk solvent
- IDEA (from David): fit a force field to reproduce the energy landscapes for a variety of
  complexes in a database 

-----MMGBSA/MMPBSA Methods-----
[not strictly relevant but this paper looked interesting]
- docking and scoring methods generally cannot differentiate between compounds
  that differ by less than an order of magnitude in affinity/ < 6 kJ/mol in
  \deltaG_bind 
- they touch on the sampling issues with alchemical methods, noting that in
  theory they are very accurate - but how accurate have they been _in
  practice_? best case? look into this...
- they note the large standard error in the 3A approach; possibility of 2A
  approach simulating ligand and complex
- GBSA is more reproducible than PBSA
- MM/PBSA calculation on single minimized structures rather than ensemble from
  simulation (this is what they do in Jiang et al. above)
- one long simulation tends to underestimate uncertainty
- however SEM is often large enough for 3A-MM/PBSA calculations that results
  are rendered useless
- "snapshots taken after 1 -- 10 ps are statistically independent
  and an equilibration of 100 ps and a production simulation
  of 100 -- 200 ps are appropriate, although later studies
  have indicated that occasionally longer equilibrations are
  needed"
- "For avidin, 20 -- 50 simulations were needed to give a
  standard error of 1 kJ/mol for the seven biotin analogues
  (6 -- 15 ns simulations for each ligand in total)"
- they describe additional ways of creating independent simulations: solvation
  of receptor, selection of alternative conformations from crystal structure,
  (with care) uncertainty of protonation and conformation of certain groups
- they note that studies have found MM/PBSA to be better than, worse than, or
  similar to mm/GBSA result, depending on the system, although theoretically it
  was assumed that PBSA would be better and so it was favored for a while
- their study indicates there isn't much to gain by using more accurate
  solvation terms for the ligand
- often the non-polar solvation term is small and differs only slightly for
  similar ligands, which seems wrong because it should model the hydrophobic
  effect, considered one of the most important effects in binding
- "the non-polar solvation energy calculated by
  SASA is three to eight times smaller and of the opposite sign
  to the same energy calculated by the more accurate PCM
  (which includes separate terms for cavitation, dispersion and
  repulsion energies) or 3D-RISM methods"
- "for more water-exposed
  binding sites, both SASA and PCM fail strongly (by up to
  32 and 78 kJ/mol, respectively) to reproduce the AP results
  and it seems to be hard to find any correction that works
  for binding sites of different solvent accessibility"
- "We have tried to estimate both these effects in a consistent
  way within the MM/GBSA approach (by estimating the binding energy also of 
  water molecules with MM/GBSA) with reasonable results"
- they found that using different force fields, as well as sophisticated charge
  models (including HF/6-31G* charges) made little differences for the E_el term
- they didn't see any improvement associated with polarizable force fields, but
  other people reported reasonable results with Amoeba
- varying the dielectric constant may matter, perhaps depending on protein
  residues
- NMA misses many aspects of the entropy, but it's really hard to get a
  converged entropy estimate from MD e.g. if you tried to use NMA with
  different conformations derived therefrom
- their QM approach to estimating E_vdw showed "that three-body
  effects (mainly the coupling between polarization and repulsion)
  absent in any standard MM representation (also polarizable)
  affect receptor--ligand interactions by 2 -- 10 kJ/mol"
- the use of QM exaggerates the differences in energy functions used for
  sampling and post-processing
- they found that an optimized alchemical perturbation approach was more
  efficient than MM/PBSA, contrary to common belief, because MMPBSA is
  inherently very imprecise so that many independent simulations are required to
  get AP-level precision
- using MM/PBSA, r^2=0.3 for the whole PDBbind database, oof
- it is tractable for larger variations in the ligand scaffold than AP
  approaches, and is less sensitive to net charge changes
- absolute affinity estimates depend strongly on the continuum solvation method
  chosen
- mean absolute deviation is often poor, i.e. worse than the null hypothesis of
  equal affinity for all ligands
- useful partial annotations in bibliography, worth checking out for more
  information on this subject
