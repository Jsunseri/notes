Ch. 1
Background on Bismarck, via Wikipedia:
In 1862, King Wilhelm I appointed Bismarck as Minister President of Prussia, a
position he would hold until 1890 (except for a short break in 1873). He
provoked three short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France,
aligning the smaller German states behind Prussia in its defeat of France. In
1871 he formed the German Empire with himself as Chancellor, while retaining
control of Prussia...Bismarck created the first welfare state in the modern
world, with the goal of gaining working class support that might otherwise go
to his Socialist enemies...While the Reichstag, Germany's parliament, was
elected by universal male suffrage, it did not have much control of government
policy; Bismarck distrusted democracy and ruled through a strong, well-trained
bureaucracy with power in the hands of a traditional Junker elite that
consisted of the landed nobility.

- Three Emperor's Alliance in 1881 composed of Russia, Austria, and Germany
- Reinsurance Treaty between Russia and Germany, maintain benevolent neutrality
  in case of war with a third, unless Germay attacks France or Russia attacks
  Austria, 1887
- 1882 Germany, Austria, Italy allied to protect Austria from a stab in the
  back from Russia and Italy from France - Triple Alliance
    - Italy has a longterm relationship with Britan, amends treaty to guarantee
      it will not be directed against Britain
    - Rumania attached in 1883
    - Serbia linked on via agreement with Austria and Spain via agreement with
      Italy (briefly; ultimately it is allied with Russia instead)
    - Russia is _not_ part of the Triple Alliance
- Germany hoped to keep Britain in friendly isolation from itself and
  unfriendly isolation from France
    - liked Disraeli but was suspicious of the Gladstonian Liberals (possibly
      the broader British government as a whole?)
        - Gladstonian Liberals were "classical" liberals in the sense of being
          in favor of balanced budgets, free trade, low taxes, laissez-faire
    - encouraged Britan's adventures in Egypt as it embroiled them with France
    - also received oversea concessions from Britan in exchange for support
      e.g. Heligoland
        - via Wikipedia: "Heligoland (German: Helgoland; Heligolandic Frisian:
          deät Lun ["the Land"]) is a small German archipelago in the North
          Sea. The islands were at one time Danish and later British possessions.
          The islands (population 1,127) are located in the Heligoland Bight (part 
          of the German Bight) in the southeastern corner of the North Sea.
          The islands are the only German islands not in the immediate vicinity
          of the mainland. They lie approximately 69 kilometres (43 miles) by sea 
          from Cuxhaven at the mouth of the River Elbe...Britain gave up the
          islands to Germany in 1890 in the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty. The newly unified
          Germany was concerned about a foreign power's controlling land from which it
          could command the western entrance to the militarily-important Kiel Canal, then
          under construction, and other naval installations in the area, and traded for
          it. A "grandfathering"/optant approach prevented the Heligolanders (as they
          were named in the British measures) from forfeiting advantages because of this
          imposed change of status."
        - Heisenberg also came up with his formulation of quantum mechanics
          there, and post WWII the Royal Navy created one of the biggest single
          non-nuclear deontations in history there, actually changing the shape
          of the island (2nd biggest nn det)
- by the end of the 1880s Germany was ready to pursue commercial expansion, but
  William II acceded to the throne and began to screw things up
    - Alexander III of Russia didn't trust William II
    - William II was raised among the military and was close with them without
      realizing that his relationship with them would result in his being
      indebted to/controlled by them
    - dismissed Bismarck
    - new Chancellor refused to renew Reinsurance Treaty with Russia
    - Russia and France subsequently enter into an alliance that says if any
      member of the Triple Alliance mobilizes, both Russia and France will too
        - Russia was mostly motivated to enter this alliance because it was
          afraid Britain was about to enter into an alliance with Germany
- pg. 4: "An essential difference between the two men [Bismarck and Wilhelm II] 
  was that the one sought security through consistent dishonesty, and the other 
  gained insecurity through spasmodic honesty."
- gradual conflict grew between Germany and Britain as Germany began to focus
  on external rather than internal expansion
    - this naturally brought its interests into conflict with Britain's
    - "As so commonly happens with great men, his disciples forgot his
      principles and remembered only his method - the mailed fist."
      (pg. 5, regarding Bismarck and subsequent German statesmen handling of
      conflict with Britain)
- some international conflicts precipitated by Germany in the 1890s:
    - with Britain over railway concessions in Turkey, wherein the Germans
      gave the British an ultimatum to stop competing with them (1892)
    - German intervention enabled Russia to deprive Japan of spoils of war with
      China (1895)
    - snotty telegram to President Kruger subtly denying British suzerainty
      over the Transvaal following the Jameson raid (1986)
        - motivated by frustrations over British military interests in South
          Africa that conflicted with Germany's interests there
        - "At a council on January 3rd, 1896, he suggested that Germany should
          proclaim a protectorate over the Transvaal and send troops thither.
          When the Chancellor, Hohenlohe, objected 'that would be war with England', 
          the Kaiser ingenuously replied, 'Yes, but only on land.'"
        - via Wikipedia: "The Jameson Raid (29 December 1895 – 2 January 1896)
          was a botched raid against the South African Republic (commonly known
          as the Transvaal) carried out by British colonial statesman Leander Starr
          Jameson and his Company troops ("police" in the employ of Beit and Rhodes'
          British South Africa Company) and Bechuanaland policemen over the New Year
          weekend of 1895–96. Paul Kruger was president of the republic at the time. The
          raid was intended to trigger an uprising by the primarily British expatriate
          workers (known as Uitlanders) in the Transvaal but failed to do so. The workers
          were called the Johannesburg conspirators. They were expected to recruit an
          army and prepare for an insurrection. The raid was ineffective and no uprising
          took place, but it was an inciting factor in the Second Boer War and the Second
          Matabele War."
- the German-British pseudo-altercation over the Transvaal became the beginning
  of German military development in earnest
    - "the trident must be in our fist", significant moves in naval development
      and military investment
- also provocations with Britain and France when the Kaiser declared Germany
  the protector of all Mohammedans throughout the world while in Damascus
- also provocation with Russia when establishing Germany as the "patron saint"
  of Turkey; Russia wanted to acquire Constantinople, and now it saw Germany as
  a major barrier standing in its way
- "Like the opponents whom Napoleon derided, the Kaiser failed in policy because
  he 'saw too many things at once', and forced the other powers, whom Bismarck
  had played off against each other, to see only one thing - the fist of Ger-
  many - wherever they looked." (pg. 6)
- despite all these things, the affront over South Africa was actually followed
  by Chamberlain offering the alliance Bismarck had sought in vain in 1898 and again
  until 1901
    - but the Kaiser declined Chamberlain's offers, suspecting they came out of
      weakness and also because Friedrich von Holstein of Germany was a dummy
      and he simultaneously worried that Germany would become Britain's "catspaw" and
      shock-absorber against Russia
    - Liddell Hart says that the Kaiser consistently underrated Britain's
      strength and overrated Russia's (pg. 7)
- Now Germany hoped to get favorable concessions from Britain while keeping
  Britain hoping for closer diplomatic ties and simultaneously subtly
  threatening Britain with the stronger navy that had freshly expanded in 1900
- over the next few years the British government was forced to concede a lot
  just to avoid German threats being pressed into action
    - Lord Salisbury's government shows "contemptible weakness" (pg. 7) that
      Liddell Hart says might be blamed for the eventual conflict, as British
      acquiesences to German demands appeared to confirm the efficacy of the "mailed
      fist" method
- the Kaiser probably didn't seek war from the beginning, and didn't need to
  since he was getting what he wanted with much lower risk
- he also had good intentions in a lot of areas, but ignored the bad effects of
  what he did
    - "He saw himself arrayed in 'shining armour' when actually he was wearing
      the garb of Puck. He proved that making mischief makes war." (pg. 8)
- Britain warned that its era of isolation was past, and that it preferred to
  join Germany and the Triple Alliance, but it that didn't happen then it would
  contemplate rapprochement with France and Russia (and ultimately this led to
  Britain joining the Dual Alliance of F+R)
- Britain first made an alliance with Japan in 1902, and this went sort of
  badly at first
    - Marquis Ito preferred an alliance with Russia, and the alliance with
      Britain proceeded only because the negotiations in Britain happened
      before he made it to St. Petersburg
    - even then the Japanese Council of Elder statesmen weren't sure they would
      accept the British agreement, and ultimately the acceptance led to the
      Russo-Japanese war indirectly, which wasn't what the British wanted at all
        - via Wikipedia: "The alliance with the British meant, in part, that if
          any nation allied itself with Russia during any war against Japan,
          then Britain would enter the war on Japan's side. Russia could no longer count
          on receiving help from either Germany or France without there being a danger of
          British involvement in the war. With such an alliance, Japan felt free to
          commence hostilities, if necessary."
    - Russian totally blew it in the Russo-Japanese war, shocking the
      international community (the following via Wikipedia)
        - the war quickly became very unpopular at home, making the whole
          Romanov dynasty even more unpopular and leading to the first revolution 
          in 1905 and the second in 1917
        - Poland, partitioned by Russia in the 18th century, had been roiling
          with revolutionary fervor for a while and revolutionaries there
          attempted to collaborate with the Japanese
        - the war resulted in a lot of international respect for Japan
        - it decimated the Russian Pacific and Baltic fleets
        - it made Russia look a lot weaker than people had thought, which
          affected Germany's decision to go to war with France and Serbia,
          Russia's allies
        - also a lot of serious financial issues happening, with both Russia
          and Japan receiving significant outside funding
            - in particular, Russia had poor finances even in peacetime; it ran
              budget deficits every year and relied heavily on France to stay
              solvent
            - the French government had to bribe the press to prevent public
              outcry about the later wartime loans, which it felt it necessary
              to make because it recognized that Russian and French finances 
              were dependent (possibly because Russia was so indebted to France?)
- 1904 brought the Entente Cordiale between Britain and France, in part made
  possible by an agreement that Britain could continue to occupy Egypt if
  France would be permitted to occupy Morocco if it could
- the Kaiser then attempted to break up the alliances among his various rivals:
    - first he encouraged Russia to send the Black Sea Fleet through the
      Dardanelles in defiance of Britain during R-J war, which they refused
    - then when Russia's Baltic Fleet sailed east it received false info
      (Russia later alleged from Germany) asserting that Japanese torpedo craft
      were hiding in the North Sea, leading them to mistakenly fire on British
      trawlers 
        - they made things worse by not apologizing for this right away
    - this temporarily brought Russia and Britain to the brink of war, and then
      almost led Russia to sign a treaty with Germany which they ultimately
      declined
    - then Germany challenged France's claims in Morocco
    - and attempted to get Russian to sign a treaty again, failed
- Sir John Fisher of Britain apparently was a big talker around this time, and
  threw around statements to the effect that if Germany wouldn't limit naval
  expansion then her fleet should be "Copenhagened" on the Nelson model (pg. 11)
  (see Battle of Copenhagan 1801 for details)
- Britan didn't want to formally commit to a treaty with France, but intended
  to intervene on France's behalf should it be attacked
    - the Germans had a new war plan in 1905 that assumed a British force of
      100,000 men would be on France's side; this is exactly the number France
      asked for
- the Kaiser is the nephew of British King Edward VII, and Edward doesn't seem 
  to mind riling the Kaiser up on purpose...much of the family (except Queen
  Victoria) seem to think he's an asshole
- the Kaiser is pretty interested in "the forces of Mahommedanism" under
  Prussian leadership
- by 1907 Britain doesn't have a formal agreement with France or Russia, but
  has "made up" with them such that mutual loyalty is reasonably expected
- Britain no longer has independence in a crisis which is perhaps not so great,
  e.g. Foreign Secretary Edward Grey in a memorandum in 1906:
    
'There would, I think, be a general feeling in every country that we had
behaved meanly and left France in the lurch. The United States would despise
us, Russia would not think it worthwhile to make a friendly arrangement with us
about Asia, Japan would prepare to reinsure herself elsewhere, we should be
left without a friend and without the power of making a friend and Germany
would take some pleasure in exploiting the whole situation to our disadvantage
... On the other hand the prospect of a European war and of our being involved
in it is horrible.'

- from this point on, even if it's unofficial, Europe is divided into two
  groups
    - Britain's presence in the new group makes Italy less keen on helping out
      in the old group
    - this made Germany more dependent on Austria as a partner, which is good
      if you want war and bad if you want peace
- because everyone was pretty scared of war happening, they gave free reign to
  military leadership for a while before the war actually happened, which
  probably helped ensure that the war happened when it did and resulted in more
  casualties
- Turkish revolution in 1908 
    - Bulgaria took the opportunity to declare independence from Turkey
    - Austria annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina
    - Austria had discussed the annexation ahead of time with Russia, and
      Russia had assented if Austria would help secure opening of the Dardanelles
    - Before Russia could take steps in that direction by discussing things
      ahead of time with France and Britain, the annexation was declared
    - Italy felt affronted and Serbia felt threatened
    - Germany threatened Russia with a combined German/Austrian attack if it
      didn't recognize the annexation
    - Russia felt it had no choice, but also felt that it had been tricked
    - the foreign minister resigned, then moved to the Paris embassy with a
      pretty solid hatred of Germany
    - Austria felt emboldened by the success of the "mailed-fist method of
      diplomacy"
- Germany tried to get Britain to sign an agreement (which Britain in principle
  wanted to do) that would in part prevent them from coming to France's aid
    - to which Sir Edward Grey replied "One does not make new friendships worth
      having by deserting old ones."
- lots of mistaken thoughts in Germany about Britain conspiring against them
  all along
    - e.g. common idea that Edward VII visited Austria in 1908 to try to get
      Austria to abandon Germany, when actually he visited to ask for Austria's
      help in having a better relationship with Germany
- France and Germany did agreeably settle over Morocco around this time, so
  that's something
- more duplicitousness in the Balkans
    - Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece tried to claim autonomy for Macedonia as a
      step toward expelling the Turks from Europe
    - Serbia was supposed to get Northern Albania, but Austria was worried
      about Serb ambitions and didn't want a Slav state to gain access to the
      Adriatic
    - Austria mobilized troops against Serbia, so Russia mobilized in response
    - Germany, France, and Britain came together to try to calm things down
    - the settlement created more problems: establishing Albania as an
      independent state meant that Serbia wanted something else as its spoil,
      so it claimed part of Macedonia
    - Bulgaria opposed this, but it was opposed by Serbia and Greece; Rumania
      also got involved and while this was happening Turkey reclaimed part of
      Macedonia
    - ultimately Serbia benefited the most and Bulgaria lost, and Austria
      wasn't happy about this
    - Austria wanted to attack Serbia immediately in the summer of 1913
    - Germany opposed this and tried to calm things down, but at the same time
      extended German control of the Turkish Army, which inflamed tensions with
      Russia again
    - Russia sees that this makes access to the Dardanelles very unlikely, and
      various experts state that it will only happen if there is a European war
- Austria, Russia, and Germany were all looking to war as a way to silence
  discord within their borders
- President Wilson's confidant left Berlin believing that the military party
  was determined there would be a war, at the earliest opportunity, and that
  they were ready to force Wilhelm II to abdicate if he opposed them on this
- Franz Ferdinand was sort of an ironic person to assassinate since he was
  sympathetic to the Slavs and hoped for a reconstructed empire that was a
  federation of the different nationalities
  (assassinated June 28, 1914)
    - to most Bosnian Slavs he was just a symbol so his opinions didn't matter
    - to extreme nationalists his federation ideas just made him a greater
      enemy, since it could fragment them and prevent their goal of breaking
      away from the empire to create a Yugo-Slav state with Serbia
    - pg. 17:
      "What is certain is the amazing carelessness of the Austrian authorities in
      guarding the Archduke, and their cynical indifference to the fate that befell
      this highly unpopular heir to the throne. Potiorek, the military governor of
      Bosnia and future commander of the offensive against Serbia, could not have
      done more to facilitate the task of the assassins if he had connived at it.
      Hence there must always be a suspicion that he did."
- all of Europe was horrified and indignant except for Austria and Serbia
- despite there being no evidence to implicate the Serbian government and in
  fact evidence to the contrary, even by the Austrian officials' estimations,
  Austria was determined to go to war
- Germany says "go for it, we're down" and also advises that "peaceful
  intentions should be simulated" to try to catch the Allies unprepared
- they were just concerned with getting support from Italy, Bulgaria, Rumania,
  and Turkey
- Austria then attempts to draft an ultimatum to Serbia that will definitely be
  unacceptable (Count Tisza of Austria has been objecting this whole time, but
  is brought around by arguments that if Austria doesn't take this opportunity to
  start the long-awaited conflict, Germany might revoke their partnership)
- they wait to deliver the ultimatum until the French president has just sailed
  from St. Petersburg, the Russian ambassador in Vienna has been induced to
  go on leave, and the Serbian Prime Minister is away
    - it is presented on July 23
    - it demands the repression of all propaganda against Austria;
    - Austria's right to order the dismissal of any Serbian officials; and,
    - Austria's right to post her own officials in Serbia,
    - as well as other things not mentioned directly by Liddell Hart,
      presumably because they are less of a direct violation of Serbia's
      sovereignty
    - Serbia is only given 48 hours for acceptance, and the next day Germany
      delivered notices to St. Petersburg, Paris, and London stating that the
      Austrian demands are "moderate and proper" without even having seen the
      ultimatum (pg. 19)
- two minutes before the ultimatum expired the Serbian reply was given to the
  Austrian ambassador; without reading it he broke off relations and caught the
  train, per his orders
    - three hours later orders were given to partially mobilize Austria on the
      Serbian front; simultaneously Germany and Russian started to mobilize
    - actually the Serbs had accepted all the Austrian demands except the two
      that obviously violated their status as an independent nation
    - blerg, this just shows the success of the "mailed fist" yet again
    - the response belatedly convinces the Kaiser to pull back, but he encourages
      Austria to occupy part of Serbia until they actually meet all the demands
    - meanwhile the other major powers, led particularly by Britain, attempt to
      move forward with diplomacy; Germany appears to play along only in the
      hope that Britain will be convinced not to join in with its European allies
      when the war starts
    - none of it mattered; on July 28 Austria delivered by telegram a
      declaration of war to Serbia, and Berchtold of Austria declined Sazonov
      of Russia's proposal for direct, diplomatic conversations due to the fact that
      war had already been declared
        - actually there was no reason for haste, since the army wouldn't be
          ready to move until August 12
        - Berchtold and Conrad were worried if they waited that they would lose
          German support and this opportunity for war
        - on July 27 Berchtold told the emperor "I think that a further attempt
          by the Entente Powers to bring about a peaceful solution remains
          possible only so long as a new situation has not been created by the
          declaration of war." (pg. 21) in his work to get the war started, he
          even lied about Serbian troops attacking first
- in Germany, Russia, and Austria, the statesmen's work for peace was being
  countered by Generals' entreaties to action and predictions of dire
  consequences if their advice were disregarded
- for example, Sazonov of Russia finally agrees that just a partial mobilization
  should begin, just on the Austrian front; the Gernal Staff argue that for
  "technical reasons" they can't do it, and only a general mobilization is
  possible
    - it doesn't hurt that Germany eggs them on, sending a "friendly opinion"
      that if they mobilize Germany will see it as a declaration of war, and
      Sazonov figures they mean even a partial mobilization, so in that case what's
      the point of only partially mobilizing?
- Germany is concerned about not looking like the bad guy, losing the support
  of Italy and drawing Britain in to support France and Russia
    - they try to bargain with Britain, do it badly, and it is refused; the
      Kaiser has a tantrum
- confusion and flip-flopping, but then the major powers stand firm in their
  desire to go to war; Liddell Hart says "Henceforth the 'statesmen' may
  continue to send telegrams, but they are merely waste paper. The military
  machine has completely taken charge." (pg. 24)
- Moltke, Chief of the German General Staff, states that "A European war is the
  last chance of saving Austria-Hungary," (pg. 24) in a telegram to the
  Austrian General Staff intended to encourage and direct them
- the political leaders and diplomats continue talking about negotiating, with
  the military staff saying it is "technically impossible" to stop mobilizing
  but reassuring that this does not mean they will attack, but declarations of
  war are still delivered
- Liddell Hart says that the Kaiser was now equally as frightened as Sazonov
  but "could not stop his own military machine." Moltke felt that the current
  situation was "unusually favorable" and should be used to strike, causes of
  favorability ranged from the time of the year to the status of the Russian and
  French militaries
    - L.H. singles out Berchtold, Conrad, and Moltke (representing the Great
      General Staff as a whole) as three individuals most to blame for the war
    - Leopold Berchtold was Austro-Hungarian Imperial Foreign Minister
    - Conrad von Hotzendorf was Austrian Chief of Staff and Commander in Chief
      for most of the war
    - Helmuth von Moltke (the Younger) was Chief of the German General Staff
      through the beginning of the war
- Germany sent a telegram to ascertain whether France intended to get involved
  in "a Russo-German war,' giving 18 hours for a reply; if France intended to
  remain neutral, they planned to make an impossible demand that France hand over
  fortresses at Verdun and Toul
    - Moltke had planned for a two-front war, and he said it would create too
      much chaos if he had to change to a war on only one front so they needed
      to ensure that the other front emerged
- L.H. seems to suggest that republicanism in France helped insure that the
  civil government had retained authority over the General Staff
    - since July 30 the frontier forces were brought 10 km inside the border to
      prevent a skirmish at the frontier from being used as a justification for war
    - a military handicap that is "politically wise"; the Germans did in fact
      cross the border on July 30 and 31, probably to create just such a situation
    - as a result, when Germany declared war on France on August 3 they had to
      make shit up again, blaming a French aviator for throwing bombs on their
      railway despite people immediately calling bullshit in Germany 
- German insistence on violating Belgium's neutrality guaranteed that Britain
  would be drawn into the war
- Italy decided on neutrality on July 31

Ch. 2
- difference between a "nation in arms" and a "nation at war": really the
  battlefield is only one front, and successfully waging war requires
  engineers, propagandists, industry, etc. to fight on the others
    - even in WWI leadership was just beginning to understand this
- surprise: the German reservists were comparable to their standard
  first-line army corps and ignorance of this led the French to severely
  underestimate the number of German troops
- the Germans at the outset of the war were the closest to realizing and
  exploiting the power of heavy artillery
    - two main advantages were investment in the heavy howitzer and railway
      communications
- the German military leaders were skilled and experienced, and the military
  strategy was flexible since youthful general staff officers often made
  decisions without consulting with higher-ups
    - ultimately, despite the advantages of this flexibility, this lack of
      consultation caused problems (L.H. hints at this but does not yet
      elaborate)
- the German people and particularly the conscripted soldiers had been
  convinced/propagandized for years about the importance and glory of their
  country and its future, so they were really ready to fight and passionate about
  it; the other countries either didn't have such common cause (Austria-Hungary was
  seriously fragmented, incohesive) or were only recently awakened to
  nationalistic fervor or defensive passion (the Entente Powers)
- Austro-Hungarian army had problems deriving from the nature of their empire 
    - racially heterogeneous empire, which meant that the army become ever more
      heterogeneous with universal conscription
        - often they were fighting groups who were represented within their own
          country and potentially their military ranks as well
        - motivated to distribute troops with political rather than military
          strategy in mind, since they wanted to avoid having kinsmen fight
          each other
    - also large frontier to defend
-
