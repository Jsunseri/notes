From Complexity to Simplicity: The Potential of Mean Force
- project distributions onto a subset of the coordinates to improve
  visualization/interpretability
- this projection is performed by doing a weighted average (integration) over
  the other coordinates
- the PMF is the energy whose Boltzmann factor yields the probability
  density over the chosen coordinate
- coordinates of interacting atoms are generally not statistically independent,
  and if they aren't independent, the PMF is the only energy you can get
- you can obtain a PMF for a general coordinate R = \hat{R}(r^N) by summing up
  Boltzmann factors for all configurations such that \hat{R}(r^N) = R \forall R
  to get the full distribution (compute integral using a delta function)
- if you want to get proportionality constants for PMFs, you need both the
  inverse configuration integral and the correct representation of a uniform 
  density in configuration space for the coordinates of interest (1/L for a 
  single Cartesian coordinate, 1/2pi for a dihedral angle, etc.); this makes
  sense in terms of producing a dimensionless quantity
- with a good simulation, you can just compute the quantity of interest from
  your ensemble of configurations and make a histogram; the PMF is proportional
  to the negative log of the histogram
- now the warnings about PMF limitations...
- in a one-dimensional system, the transition state is the configuration of
  highest energy between two states of interest, and the barrier height
  relevant to kinetics is the energy difference between the initial and
  transition states
- just because a PMF projects a high-dimensional landscape onto a single
  coordinate, doesn't mean the resulting landscape tells you anything about the
  transition state or barrier height/kinetics in the original space
- since there could in principle be more than one path connecting two states of
  interest, it may not even be possible in theory to define a reaction
  coordinate that describes all the aspects you need for kinetics
- when studying correlations between atom types you should use the radial
  distribution function (which is basically a pair correlation function)
- PMFs were developed in the context of distribution functions
- the radial distribution function g_ab(r) gives the probability of finding an
  atom of type "b" at a distance r from an atom of type "a", more precisely the
  relative probability compared to a uniform distribution of "b" particles
- g(r) is also easy to get from a simulation, you just need to bin because the
  simulation is finite
- the PMF and the true pairwise potential are not the same
- g(r) can be used to compute thermodynamic quantities like the average
  potential energy, and g(r) itself is experimentally measurable
- "knowledge-based" or "statistical" potentials are based on PMFs
